Changelog
=========

0.7.0 (2021-06-01)
------------------

New
~~~

- Add convenience typedefs for the monomial types
  (`#134 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/134>`__).
- The C++ standard requirement is now exported in the CMake
  config-file package installed by obake
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/128>`__).
- Implement truncated power series
  (`#127 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/127>`__).

Changes
~~~~~~~

- obake now requires mp++ >= 0.23
  (`#139 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/139>`__).
- Continue moving code from the headers into the compiled
  part of the library
  (`#134 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/134>`__).
- **BREAKING**: obake is now based on C++20, and the minimum
  CMake version has been bumped up to 3.12. As a consequence,
  obake now requires GCC >= 9, clang >= 11 and MSVC >= 2019
  (`#128 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/128>`__).
- obake now depends on the `{fmt} <https://fmt.dev/latest/index.html>`__
  library
  (`#125 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/125>`__).
- **BREAKING**: the implementation of ``packed_monomial`` and
  ``d_packed_monomial`` has changed: now when specifying the desired
  exponent type, only ``std::(u)int32_t`` and ``std::(u)int64_t``
  are supported, and using other integral types (e.g., ``long``,
  ``unsigned long long``, etc.) may lead to compile-time errors,
  depending on how ``std::(u)int32_t`` and ``std::(u)int64_t``
  are implemented on the target platform
  (`#125 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/125>`__).
- **BREAKING**: ``d_packed_monomial`` is now specified in terms
  of the number of exponents to be packed in a single integer
  rather than the bit width assigned to each exponent
  (`#125 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/125>`__).
- The Kronecker packing code has been rewritten to avoid
  division and remainder operations, leading to a
  substantial performance uplift
  (`#125 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/125>`__).
- Adopt a flyweight pattern for the representation of
  symbol sets in series
  (`#124 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/124>`__).
- When building on Windows with ``clang-cl``, obake
  now requires at least MSVC 2017. As a result, various
  limitations/workarounds originating from the need to support
  the MSVC 2015 standard library have been removed
  (`#122 <https://github.com/bluescarni/obake/pull/122>`__).
