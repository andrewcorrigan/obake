=====

    `Obake (お化け) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obake>`_ [...] are a
    class of yōkai, preternatural creatures in Japanese folklore.
    Literally, the terms mean a thing that changes, referring to a state of
    transformation or shapeshifting.

obake is a C++ computer algebra library for the symbolic
manipulation of sparse multivariate polynomials and other
closely-related symbolic objects (such as truncated power
series, Poisson series, etc.).
